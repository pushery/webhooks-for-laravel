# Changelog

All notable changes to `pushery/webhooks-for-laravel` are documented here.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and
the project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.1.2] - 2026-07-05

### Added

- Migrating the package against a non-PostgreSQL connection (MySQL or SQLite) now
  fails with one clear, actionable error instead of a cryptic SQL syntax failure —
  it names the offending driver and points to provisioning a Neon (PostgreSQL)
  database on Laravel Cloud. The package remains PostgreSQL-only by design.

### Changed

- Documented the Laravel Cloud database choice in the requirements: use the Neon
  (PostgreSQL) option rather than MySQL.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-02

### Changed

- Issue templates (bug report + feature request) now ship to the public repository
  automatically with each release, and a lean `.gitattributes` keeps the Composer
  dist minimal.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-02

### Added

- Customer-configurable outgoing webhooks on top of spatie/laravel-webhook-server:
  register endpoints per event type and fan an event out to every matching, active
  subscription with `WebhookEvent::dispatch()` (tenant-scoped or global).
- Postgres delivery log: uuid-keyed, monthly range-partitioned `webhook_deliveries`
  table with a partial index for open rows, plus `webhook_subscriptions` with a jsonb
  event-type list (GIN indexed), an encrypted signing secret, and a nullable owner morph.
- Versioned, Stripe-style HMAC-SHA256 signature (`t=<unix>,v1=<sig>`) signed at send
  time, with zero-downtime secret rotation and a shippable `SignatureVerifier` for consumers.
- SSRF-hardened delivery: every URL is validated at registration and again at send time,
  with the connection pinned to the validated IP to defeat DNS rebinding; private,
  loopback, link-local, unique-local, carrier-grade-NAT, multicast and cloud-metadata
  addresses are refused, and redirects are not followed.
- Stable per-event id for consumer idempotency, preserved across manual redelivery.
- Circuit breaker that auto-disables an endpoint after repeated final failures, and
  `WebhookDeliverySucceeded` / `WebhookDeliveryFailed` / `WebhookEndpointAutoDisabled` events.
- Per-endpoint rate limiting, Horizon tags, a configurable event catalog, and a
  `webhooks:partition-maintenance` command (scheduled daily) for provisioning and retention.
- Optional JSON-Schema payload validation: give an event type a `schema` in the catalog
  and enable `validate_payloads`, and a non-conforming payload is rejected with
  `InvalidPayloadException` before any delivery is created (off by default).
- Optional Livewire management UI shipped as publishable, restyleable stubs
  (`WebhooksUiServiceProvider`, not auto-registered), in two variants: neutral Tailwind
  (`webhooks-ui`) and WireKit-styled (`webhooks-ui-wirekit`).
